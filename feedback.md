Overall Assessment: 1.5/5

Additional Comments: 

There are a few things that are not written correctly here. Rather than listing all of them I'd like you to be engaged in the review lecture. There will be many moments when you'll see a clear difference in the solution we go over and the code you wrote here. You should be asking clarifying questions in those moments. I should be hearing your voice a lot during the review lecture. 

## Updated: Take a look at the following methods

<!-- - `Author.all`
    - This should be returning a list of all of the authors that were created -->

<!-- - `author.books` returns a list of `bookauthor` instances. It should return a list of `book` instances

- `Book.all`
    - This should return a list of all of the `book` instances created -->

- `book.title`, `book.word_count`, `book.author` are all incorrectly written. `book.author` should have been refactored to `book.authors` once changed to a many to many and that method is incorrectly written for a many to many relationship as well. 

There are some pretty obvious differences in your code VS what Ian just did in lecture. I'd strongly recommend you go through and be able to identify yourself where the mistakes are and how they should be corrected
