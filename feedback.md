Overall Assessment: 1.5/5

Additional Comments: 

There are a few things that are not written correctly here. Rather than listing all of them I'd like you to be engaged in the review lecture. There will be many moments when you'll see a clear difference in the solution we go over and the code you wrote here. You should be asking clarifying questions in those moments. I should be hearing your voice a lot during the review lecture.
